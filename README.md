# Ecosystem destruction and restoration

Ever since settler colonialism started on this continent, there have been many
changes to the environment. Some of those changes seemed simple at first, like
changes to farming and hunting. We moved from a sustenanice model to a growth
model. We moved from a nutritious self-fertilizing cluster of plants in milpa
fashion into a mass monocrop style of farming. Over time those simple changes
have compounded into a giant issue where we don't seem to be able to get as many
nutrients into plants and when we try, the fertilizer washes out when the rains
come and create problems with bacteria in waterways and dead-zones along the
coast. In addition to the changes in farming, there was an incresed demand for
fur coats and wood. Then came the demand for metals. The new nation saw a vast
supply of resources waiting to be extracted and turned in commodities.

  * `Edwards Dam was built in Augusta, Maine, in 1837 to ease navigation and harness energy. That act drowned 17 miles (27 kilometers) of riffles and rapids and the unique character of this magnificent river. The Kennebec River was once home to all ten species of migratory fish native to Maine—including Atlantic salmon, American shad, several species of herring, alewife, and Shortnose and Atlantic sturgeon—along with several thriving commercial fisheries. Damming the river not only transformed the natural landscape but it also ushered in an era of industrialization, pollution, degradation, and neglect.`
  * `A decade later, more than two million alewives returned to the Kennebec, the largest migration of its kind on the eastern seaboard. The entire web of life, from eagles to osprey to black bears, have benefited from the free-flowing river. Water quality classifications have been upgraded, and mayflies and stoneflies, rarely seen in samples before the removal of Edwards, have dramatically increased in number.`

#### Research Papers
* [Bellmore JR, et al. (2019) Conceptualizing Ecological Responses to Dam Removal: If You Remove It, What's to Come? BioScience. 69(1): 26-39.](https://doi.org/10.1093/biosci/biy152)
  * `However, upstream movement of organisms, such as fish, are also crucial to the function of river ecosystems (Pringle 1997). Dams can reduce biodiversity and productivity by severing these upstream flows (Pess et al. 2008). When dams are removed and longitudinal connectivity is restored, fishes, invertebrates, and commensal microorganisms living on or within these mobile species can recolonize (or initially colonize) upstream habitats. This upstream movement of organisms is a major driver of ecological responses above the former dam and reservoir (figure 2).`
  * `As is illustrated in the upstream causal-loop diagram in figure 2, reestablishment of longitudinal connectivity can increase species richness, life history diversity, and the delivery of nutrients and organic matter upstream of the former dam. For example, in the midwestern and eastern United States, low-head dam removals resulted in increased numbers of fish species upstream of the former dam sites (Burdick and Hightower 2006, Catalano et al. 2007, Burroughs et al. 2010, Magilligan et al. 2016).`
  * `Within a year following the removal of Elwha Dam (one of two large dams removed from the Elwha River, Washington), marine-derived nutrients from adult Pacific salmon were detected upstream of the former dam site in American dippers (Cinclus mexicanus)—an obligate aquatic songbird that feeds on aquatic invertebrates, small fish, and salmon eggs (Tonra et al. 2015).`

## Land defenders killed

Some stats:
• 1,558 people have been killed between 2002 and 2017 while fighting for the environment.
• 68% of these people (1,059 people) were killed in South America (the biggest offenders being Colombia and Brazil).
• 40% of these people (623 people) are Indigenous.
• In 2018, 164 more people were killed bringing the total to 1722 between 2002 and 2018.
• These are only what is known, the numbers could be much higher.
• The research paper finds a correlation between "rule of law", corruption, and the deaths.

## Fire

The severity of fires has been increasing in many areas. This is just a consequence of climate change + how we live + capitalism. California is facing a crisis on multiple fronts because PG&E had refused to properly manage its funds and assets which lead to fires across California. This lead to a lawsuit and now the way PG&E is managing the problem is leading to other froms of crisis since many California residence have medical problems and their life rests on having electricity to support them.

Most recently the Saddleridge fire has prompted hundreds of thousands of people to have to evacuate their homes in the Northern Los Angles area. It has crossed highways 210 and 5, with the 405 being closed. Additionally, there are a few other fires burning in the area. The Sandalwood Fire in Calimesa has burned 500 acres and as of 11 Oct was only 10% contained. In Moreno Valley, the Reche Fire is also only 10% contained. The poor air quality caused by the fires has caused 40 schools to close until further notice.

This comes one year after a previous outbreak of fires.

### Solar and E-Waste

When one thinks of solar power, one probably thinks of a magical source of green energy with no no carbon footprint. Unfortunately, that cheery picture is not the reality. Solar panels must be manufactured and they must eventually be replaced. Since glass is typically one of the layers involved, that means the right kind of sand needs to be melted down to make the glass. Fortunately glass is the easiest part to recycle, but it still takes energy. After the glass is made, the next step is the same as manufacturing modern electronics. For thin film solar panels it takes mining rare metals, producing the toxic chemicals required, and forming each layer of the panel. For the panels most people have, manufacturing takes fewer toxic chemicals, but more silicon made from sand. Solar panels are actually easier to recycle than most electronics, which have hundreds of components mounted in place on a multilayer circuit board using a conductive molten metal alloy called solder. The complexity of modern electronics requires a decent amount of energy to build. It would stand to reason that recylcling it would also take a decent amount of energy.

Recycling technology has not receved much focus until recent years. Recycling is done mostly by hand, while manufacturing is more automated. In many cases, people orginally just thought they could throw away electronics that have gone bad. This is bad because while it would seem the toxic slurry of chemicals used to make the components is sealed away, it isn't. All those electronics thrown away are leaching toxins and rare metals (sometimes those are one in the same) into the environment. Then when the rains come, it pollutes the environments and washes into streams.

Since solar panels are made using many of the same techniques as modern semiconductors, solar panels have almost exactly the same problems as modern consumer electronics. Consumer electronics have been a terrible environmental pollutant. All one needs to do is look at the Chinese cities of Guiyu and ???. Fortunately we now have ways of minimizing the toxins released into the environment by recylcling electronics, but we need to find ways to make electronics less toxic, to lower the energy required to recycle electronics, and minimize the waste from parts that cannot be recycled.
